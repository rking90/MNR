You will receive an email from the MMO team (for now - soon organisations will email you directly).
It will come into the Noise monitoring inbox and will state voluntary notification in the subject line.

The email should include a voluntary notification form and additional documentation
> Supplementary documentation can include:
  > Shape files
  > Risk assessments
  > Supplementary environmental documents
  etc
  
The voluntary notification form is presented in the same format 
The majority of information "could" be obtained from here.
