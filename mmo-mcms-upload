Trouble shooting
===

> Fee Band 1, 2 or 3
If you receive a band 3 application, contact the case team or case officer related.
>- In the meantime, input the application in to the MMO spreadsheet and note that the application is band 3

When checking with Case officer
>-	Check if application was done by mistake.
>-	Check application to see if licence condition is included: 
(band 3 applications should have a licence condition added to the subsequent licence requiring the applicant to complete data entry to the MNR.) <- what the holy hell does this mean???

> Impulsive / Not Impulsive
> If the application indicates that the piling activites are vibro or other (not impulsive) the application is not required to be uploaded to the MNR

> Inside/Outside Remit
> Sometimes the activity is occurring far enough up river that it falls outwith the MNR remit as it is unlikely to impact marine wildlife.
