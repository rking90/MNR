This gives you all the apps put forward under that MAT# e.g. RY: SA/11B9

Only need to look at the newest version if the GS number is the same
e.g. GS/1009/1 (version 3) Vs GS/1009/2

Only upload those with status of “completed / approved” rather than: 
“cancelled, rejected or in progress”

If DL# present, record in spreadsheet & supplementary info
> Variation always trumps version 
e.g (as above) GS/1009/2 trumps GS/1009/1 (Version 3)  
Therefore the GS/1009/2 will be the version to upload

>Version is changed before consent is given / variation is when consent is given
